Code for transforming between astronomical photometric equations.

Some results based on this code can be found on the Dark Energy Survey Data Release 2 (DES DR2) webpage
(https://des.ncsa.illinois.edu/releases/dr2/dr2-docs/dr2-transformations) and in the DES DR2 paper 
(https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021ApJS..255...20A/abstract). 

If you make use this code for your own work, please consider acknowledging the upcoming paper Allam, Tucker, et al. (in prep.).
